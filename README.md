The reasons why I deiced to use lambda are as below:  
1. Faster Development with serverless architecture  
Only need to care about the code without handling the server.  
2. HA  
Avaliable for 7x24 and will not stop suddenly.
3. Easier Operational Management  
No need to have system administration.
